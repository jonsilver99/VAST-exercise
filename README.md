# VAST create and view

- This app saves VAST records to db - a vast record contains url that returns a vast xml (XML only) along with additional layout data.
- The app allows users to view saved vasts by displaying the XML (text).   
- If the vast contains a valid url to an mp4 video - the app will also play the vast (video).
